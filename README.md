# HTML Cheatsheet

This project is a simple guide with basic HTML information. The information can be copied in one click from each area. The interface is fully accessible with keyboards and screen readers.

- This is currently a work-in-progress! Not 100% happy with the layout, so will probably end up tweaking it!
